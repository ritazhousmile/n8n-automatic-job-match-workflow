# n8n-automatic-job-match-workflow

## 📌 Project: AI-Powered Job Recommendation Workflow with n8n

This project demonstrates how to deploy n8n locally and build a real-world AI-powered job recommendation workflow. The workflow automates the entire process of finding job listings, analyzing them against your resume using AI, generating personalized cover letters, and delivering top matches directly to your inbox.

## 🎯 Purpose

To learn and showcase how to:
- Deploy and configure n8n locally
- Build complex, multi-step workflows
- Integrate third-party APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed, Google Gemini, Notion, Gmail, etc.)
- Use AI models for real-world automation (resume parsing, job matching, cover letter writing)

## ⚙️ Core Workflow Features

- 🔍 **Job Listing Aggregation**: Automatically scrape job listings from multiple platforms such as LinkedIn and Indeed using HTTP request nodes or custom scripts.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Job Matching**: Use Google Gemini (or other LLM APIs) to analyze your resume and compare it against scraped job descriptions. Assign a match score based on relevance.
- 📝 **Personalized Cover Letter Generation**: Generate tailored cover letters using LLM prompts based on the job posting and your resume.
- 📬 **Email Delivery**: Send a daily or weekly digest of high-matching jobs (above a score threshold) directly to your email using Gmail or SMTP integration.
- 📅 **Scheduled Automation**: Trigger the workflow on a regular schedule (e.g., daily at 8 AM) using the Cron node or Scheduler trigger.
- 📘 **Notion Integration for Job Tracking**: Automatically log top matches and application status in a Notion database for centralized job management and tracking.

## 🔄 Workflow Overview (Step-by-Step)

1. Trigger (Scheduled / Cron)
2. Fetch Resume from local file, Notion, or cloud storage
3. Scrape Jobs using HTTP requests or scraping services
4. Parse & Format job descriptions
5. Compare each job to the resume using Google Gemini API
6. Generate Cover Letters for top-scoring matches
7. Update Notion with job and cover letter info
8. Send Email with the best job recommendations

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes


### 1. Deploy n8n Locally
